// Given two numbers, we need to check if they are amicable numbers or not.

// 1. Take two numbers as input<- number1, number2
// 2. Find the divisors of the first number < - divisors1
// 3. Find the divisors of the second number < - divisors2
// 4. Find the sum of the divisors of the first number < - sum1
// 5. Find the sum of the divisors of the second number < - sum2
// 6. If sum1 is equal to number2 and sum2 is equal to number1, then the numbers are amicable numbers
// 7. Else, the numbers are not amicable numbers
